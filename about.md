My name is Saumya Bhatnagar and I'm a full time PhD Statistics candidate at the University of Cincinnati. I'm currently in my 4th year and working on my research in the field of Spatial Statistics. I've created this space to share some of the projects I have worked on these past few years as I try to explore internship opportunities in the industry for the Summer 2019. 

I also hold a Masters of Science degree in Statistics from the University of Cincinnati (awarded Spring 2017) and another Masters of Science degree in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from Motilal Nehru Institute of Technology, Allahabad (India). I've been teaching first year undergraduate students Calculus and Elementary Statistics for the past couple of years and enjoy interacting and learning with them.
